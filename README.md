# Hotel-KAI

Welcome to the UI/UX design project for Hotel KAI! 
This is a faculty project that aims to create a user-friendly web application for hotel management. 
The project contains two sides: an admin side for managing hotel operations, and a user/guest side for booking rooms and accessing hotel information. 
In addition to the design mockups located in the "img" folder, I have also created a short demonstration video of my web app. You can watch it on my YouTube channel by following the link below.
